NOTE on mgcv::gam models with random factor smooth (bs="fs") terms

As an example, take the model 
    `o ~ s(z) + s(z,y,bs="fs")` 
where `o` represnts the observations, `z` is a covariate and `y` is a factor 
representing the random effects. 

The interpretation of this model is that `s(z)` is the mean response in the 
absence of any random effects while the `s(z,y)`, term represents the interaction 
between `z` and the random effects categorized by `y`. 

If the estimated reponse `r` is regarded as a function of `z` and `y`, then 
r(z|y) = r(z,y) is the estimated response given the random factor `y`.Because `y` 
represents random effects, the real interest is not in the response for any 
particular observed level of `y`, but rather it is in the expected reponse for 
any `y`, i.e. the expected marginal response 
   `r(z) = Integral_y r(z|y)*p(y)*dy`
which, if the random effects are considered iid, implies 
    `r(z) = s(z)`.
    
However, it is important to note that the *uncertainty* associated with `r(z)` is 
**not** the same as the uncertainty associated with only `s(z)`, but also 
includes the uncertainty associated with the random effects.

Setting up the data and model
  1. Data: convert `y` to a factor and add an additional level not already in `y`, e.g.
    dfrESsp1 = dfrESsp |> dplyr::mutate(y=factor(as.character(y),levels=c("1",levels(y))));
  2. Model: define the gam model with a smooth term `s(z,y,b="fs")` [note: don't use `ti`] 
            and set `drop.unused.levels=FALSE`, e.g.:
    mdl4m = mgcv::gam(emp_sel ~ s(z,k=10) + s(z,y,bs="fs",k=10),
                       family=tw,data=dfrESsp1,method="REML",
                       weights=n_BSFRF/mean(n_BSFRF),
                      drop.unused.levels=FALSE);
  3. To obtain the estimated marginal response, define a new dataframe to use 
     in the `predict` function that includes all values of `z` of interest and only 
     the additional factor level for y. Include **all** model terms in the call to 
     `predict`.
