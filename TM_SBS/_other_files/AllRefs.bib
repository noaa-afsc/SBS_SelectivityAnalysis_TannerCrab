At the same time, the catch of males of commercial size per day was 13.474 tons or 7600 pcs. However, this value does not reflect the real possibility of catching per day, since it is limited to the possibility of raw material processing per day (15--16 tons). Information on the size-weight composition of catches and the biological state of crabs is given, as well as the species composition of the by-catch of other species of fish and invertebrates in trap fishing is analyzed.},

The level of such catches is estimated in comparison with the previous decade; a comparative assessment of the operated species is made. The structure conformity of the actual biological resources catching with the predicted one is considered. It was established that according to the degree of predicted catch development herring and salmon were in the lead, crabs were in third place and pollock was the fourth one. A significantly poor catch was observed in relation to other important fishery objects and the most pronounced was for molluscs.},

	abstract = {State of the blue crab stock and production is considered for the Russian sector of the {Bering Sea} on the data of bottom trawl and trap surveys conducted by TINRO in 2005--2017 and fishery statistics. The commercial stock was assessed for 2018 by cohort analysis. The absolute majority of commercial males within the West {Bering Sea} fishing zone concentrated in two areas located at Koryak coast and at Cape Navarin, whereas the commercial aggregations were absent in the Olyutorsky Bay and Karaginsky Bay. The stock distribution between these two areas was unstable; recently the aggregation at Koryak coast increased to 72 {\%} of the total number of commercial males in 2017. This dynamics is conditioned by both changes in reproduction and intensity of fishery. The total commercial stock of blue crab had increased since 2014 and reached the maximum of 18.133 ×106 ind. (males) in 2017 that exceeded significantly the level of 2005--2013. The blue crab fishery extends in the {Bering Sea}, since 2010 the portion of used TAC increased from approximately 93 {\%} in 2011--2015 to 98 {\%} in 2016--2017 and 99 {\%} in 2018. State of the population is evaluated as satisfactory and stable.},

Morphological 50{\%} maturation of males in the northwestern part of the Sea of Okhotsk was observed at the carapace width of 73.3 mm. Similar width were demonstrated for the northeastern part of the sea and for the Iona Bank area --respectively 88.5 mm and 91.0 mm. Females in samples from the northwestern part of the sea reached functional 50{\%} maturity at the carapace width of 71.7 mm, from the northeastern part --of 79.4 mm, and from the Iona Bank --of 81.0 mm. Comparison with available literature data showed that blue crab in the northwestern part of the Sea of Okhotsk has probably the slowest growth rate, and the crabs have the smallest size at maturity compared to individuals in the other areas.},

	abstract = {The aim of the research is a retrospective analysis of the stock of the blue king crab {Paralithodes platypus} inhabiting the western part of the {Bering Sea}, to show the prospects of using the relative abundance index (I{\%}N) as an assessment characterizing the state of the stock of this species. It is based on the data of direct accounting of P. platypus during trawl and trap surveys in 2005--2021. For each year, an index of relative abundance was established, expressed as a percentage of the maximum number of crabs noted in the retrospective period. The I{\%}N index was determined for different functional groups of the crab separately and for combined size and age groups. The use of the relative abundance index I{\%}N in quartiles makes it possible to apply a four-zonal evaluation characteristic of the stock status of P. platypus: the stock condition is good, satisfactory, uncertain and depressive. This indicative method displays the dynamics of the state of the stock in the studied period and visualizes its variability in the historical period. In the West {Bering Sea} population of P. platypus, there has recently been a decrease in the number, which is less than 40 {\%} of the maximum number observed during the study period. In all functional groups of P. platypus, the estimate of abundance (stock) is currently characterized as uncertain. The retrospective dynamics of the relative abundance index I{\%}N is an additional operational indicator in making a management decision when developing P. platypus as a commercial reserve unit in the western part of the {Bering Sea}.},

	abstract = {The results in the water area from island Big Shantar to the Babushkina Bay points to the existence of morphometric differences in the blue crab from the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk. The proportions of the crab's body change statistically significantly: in the direction from the west (severe hydrological regime) to the east (relatively warm area) crabs become more elongated in width, the right claw in all measured parameters and the height of the left claw decrease relative to the width of the carapace, and there was also a decrease in the length of the merus of the first walking leg. With the inclusion of materials from the Shelikhov Bay in the correlation analysis, in addition to the previously found dependences (associated with the fishing length of the carapace and the height of the right claw), the clinal variability of the length of the second pereopod was also noted: its shortening occurs as in the first pereopod in the direction from west to east. When performing discriminant analysis (the sample from Shelikhov Bay was not included), the most significant morphometric differences were noted between the most remote areas: western and eastern (Dₘ²=2,95--3,72), which, apparently, is a consequence of contrasting environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {The material of spring registration surveys of the blue king crab {Paralithodes platypus} conducted in the Shelikhov Bay of the Okhotsk Sea from 2007 to 2019 is presented. It is proposed to use the relative abundance index (I{\%}N) for a quick assessment of the characterizing state of the stock of the exploited population. The index I{\%}N is defined as the ratio of the number of a separate functional group of the crab to the maximum number for this group of crab in the study period, expressed as a percentage. A similar algorithm was used to determine the index of the relative density of the distribution of crabs (I{\%}P) and the index of the relative average daily catch of fishing vessels for the first half of the year (I{\%}M). When comparing the relative indices I{\%}N, I{\%}P, I{\%}M, the most convincing was the relative population index I{\%}N. To assess the stock status of the studied functional group of crabs in the values of the index I{\%}N, it was proposed to distinguish 4 quartiles (interval 25 units): 1st quartile (Q₁) I{\%}N <75 stock condition is good; 2nd quartile (Q₂) I{\%}N = 51--75 stock condition is satisfactory or relatively stable; 3rd quartile (Q₃) I{\%}N 26--50 stock status uncertain; 4th quartile (Q₄) I{\%}N ≤25 stock status is unsatisfactory or depressive. The boundary values between quartiles Q₁--Q₂, Q₂--Q₃, and Q₃--Q₄are I{\%}N values of 75, 50, and 25, respectively. The dynamics of the I{\%}N index in the studied time period reflects the real process taking place in the fishing unit of the stock based only on empirical data.},

The red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus), depth range 79--277 m, was studied in the Kamchatka-Kuril subzone. A the blue king crab (P. platypus) with a depth range of 163--177 m was studied in the West Kamchatka subzone. There were 4 types of crabs in the by-catch. Samplers were cone traps. The biological analysis consisted of a random sample of crabs taken from several traps. In crabs, physiological and biochemical parameters were studied, reflecting their relationship with the linocyclic cycles of crabs. In the Kamchatka-Kuril subzone, the stock of P. camtschaticus is in poor con-dition, and the population of the southern {Tanner} crab (Chionoecetes bairdi), on the contrary, it is intensively restored. In the West Kamchatka subzone, the condition of the blue king crab stock is satisfactory, and the snow crab (C. opilio) mainly consists of individuals who have long completed terminal molting, and they will be eliminated in the next two years.},

@article{LyonsEtAl2016,
	abstract = {Rebuilding fisheries is a difficult process and many stocks that are declared overfished fail to recover even in the absence of fishing pressure. The {Pribilof Islands} stock of the blue king crab ({Paralithodes platypus} Brandt, 1850) in {Alaska}, USA is one of these recovery failures. To explore how environmental and ecological factors might interact to suppress this stock, we conducted a suite of laboratory experiments to assess the effects of temperature changes and the presence of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus Tilesius, 1815) on blue king crab habitat preference and fish predation survival. Age-0 blue king crabs exhibited plasticity in habitat preference mediated by changes in water temperature, as well as the presence and density of juvenile red king crabs. While blue king crabs are often associated with shell-hash habitat, increases in water temperature, as well as the presence of red king crab at high densities, caused blue king crab juveniles to shift into habitats with an algal mimic present, a habitat type shown to reduce the predation efficacy of red king crabs. In contrast, red king crabs exhibited fewer changes in habitat preference with changes in water temperature and the presence of a congener. Blue king crabs are therefore behaviorally plastic, switching from strategies of predator avoidance when predator encounter rates are likely low, to predator deterrence strategies when encounter rates are higher. Fish predation trials further support the idea that blue king crabs are more focused on predator avoidance than are red king crabs. In fish predation trials run separately for the two crab species, blue king crabs had higher survival (60{\%}) than red king crabs (33{\%}) when exposed to fish predators. Our results indicate that age-0 blue king crabs can be less vulnerable to fish predation than red king crabs, but future research should assess how fish predation rates change when presented with higher densities of red and blue king crab in mixed assemblages as the observed habitat shifts could affect predation survival.},

	abstract = {A herpes-like virus was found infecting the antennal gland and bladder epithelium in the blue king crab {Paralithodes platypus} from the eastern area of the Sea of Okhotsk. Electron microscopic analysis of antennal gland samples from blue king crabs with histologically confirmed signs of disease revealed virus particles, which were mostly hexagonal in shape and located primarily in the nucleus; these particles were rarely observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Most virus particles ranged in size from 115 to 125nm. Hemocytes of the red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus in cell culture could be experimentally infected with virus from thawed antennal gland samples of the blue king crabs with histologically confirmed signs of viral infection. Clear signs of infection were observed in hemocyte cultures at 3-4days post-inoculation as small foci of highly vacuolated formations. These formations included several nuclei and were surrounded by a halo of small cytoplasmic bubbles containing actin and tubulin. As demonstrated by electron microscopic studies, no virus-like particles were found in the cells 1day post-inoculation, but particles become abundant at 7days post-inoculation. We developed a consensus primer PCR method for amplification of a region of the herpesviral DNA-directed DNA polymerase. Primers were designed to target sequences encoding highly conserved amino acid motifs covering a region of approximately 800bp. Thus, macroscopic, histological and ultra-structural examinations of blue king crabs infected with a virus and the molecular identification of the pathogen revealed the presence of herpesviruses. The frequency of the herpes-like viral infection in natural populations of blue king crabs in the Sea of Okhotsk ranged from 0{\%} to 3{\%} in different years.},

	abstract = {Bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) of the western Arctic stock winter in ice-covered continental shelf regions of the {Bering Sea}, where pot fisheries for crabs (Paralithodes and Chionoecetes spp.) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) pose a risk of entanglement. In the winter of 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 the spatial distribution of 21 satellite tagged bowhead whales partially overlapped areas in which pot fisheries for cod and blue king crab ({Paralithodes platypus}) occurred. However, these fisheries ended before whales entered the fishing areas, thus avoiding temporal overlap. A fishery for snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) typically runs from January to May and provides the greatest potential for bowhead whales to encounter active pot gear. Tagged whales did not enter the area of the snow crab fishery during this study and generally remained in areas with >90{\%} sea ice concentration, which is too concentrated for crab boats to penetrate. Pack ice sometimes overruns active fishing areas, resulting in lost gear, which is the most likely source of entanglement. The western Arctic stock of bowhead whales was increasing as of 2004; as such, incidental mortality from commercial pot fisheries is probably negligible at this time. Regardless, entanglement may increase over time and should be monitored.},

However, little is known about the species' first year of post-settlement life. This study was conducted to evaluate how temperature mediates growth and energy allocation beginning with the first benthic instar (stage C1). Juvenile BKC were reared in four temperatures (1.5 to 12 degree C) for a period of 60days in low-density populations (150crabsm-2) and 120days in individual cultures. Growth rate increased rapidly up to 8 degree C, and then leveled off. At 60days, most of the crabs in 1.5 degree C remained at stage C1, most in 4.5 degree C were C2, and most in 8 degree C were C3, while those in 12 degree C were highly variable and ranged from C2 to C5. Growth records for individuals revealed an inverse exponential relationship between water temperature and intermolt period (up to 8 degree C). A small decrease in molt increment at 12 degree C resulted in crabs 6{\%} smaller than those at 8 degree C. Total lipid content increased with temperature in C2 BKC, but the response was variable and not significant in later stages. The proportion of storage class lipids (triacylglycerols) increased with an increase in temperature and polar lipids decreased. Concentrations of essential fatty acids were relatively constant over all temperature treatments, indicating that temperature and growth rate did not affect the biochemical condition of juvenile BKC. Survival rates of BKC (>95{\%}) were similar across temperatures and were much higher than rates observed for red king crab (RKC) (Paralithodes camchaticus Tilesius 1815) (65-72{\%}) in identical experiments. Growth rates of the two species were nearly identical up to 8 degree C, but RKC grew faster than BKC at temperatures greater than 8 degree C, with more molts resulting in larger individuals. Fatty acid (FA) signatures supported the lipid class data and showed that BKC had higher proportions of FA associated with energy storage while RKC had higher proportions of polyunsaturated FAs associated with membranes. These results indicate that BKC are the hardier species, and it shows little sign of cannibalism in culture (unlike RKC), but RKC grow faster at high temperature and are less vulnerable to warming climate. These data help to model temperature-dependent recruitment processes in the field and assist in the design of diets and hatchery conditions for production of seed stocks intended for field release.},

The composition, distribution, and quantitative characteristics of benthos in the areas of sampling are analyzed. The generalized pattern of distribution of the considered crabs is shown with the maximum and mean densities. These crabs were found to consume at least three to four single portions of food during 10-12 hours of daylight. The lowest feeding intensity was observed in the opilio snow crab in March and April. Cannibalism proved to be typical for all the studied crab species in the spring. It was most developed in the deepwater red snow crab, in whose diet representatives of the same species constituted a one-third share. It was also noted that the diet of the studied crabs included a major proportion of crabs and shrimps, which was unusual for the feeding habits of the same species in other Far Eastern seas.},

	abstract = {The Bering Strait marks the northern species boundary for blue king crabs ({Paralithodes platypus}), but the life history of the population at this latitude has never been described in scientific literature. Blue king crabs were collected in shallow (10-23 m) waters near King Island (n: males == 199; females == 260) in July of 2005 and from near Little Diomede Island (n: males == 40; females == 19) in April of 2007 for morphometric, fecundity and hatch timing information. Crabs from Little Diomede and King Islands showed no significant difference in male carapace length (CL) by location and were smaller than blue king crabs from more southern parts of the state (mean CL A-A- SE: 108.45 A-A- 0.70 mm). Females from King Island (mean CL A-A- SE: 99.47 A-A- 0.52 mm) were significantly larger than female crabs collected from Little Diomede Island (mean CL A-A- SE: 93.11 A-A- 2.96 mm) and male crabs (mean CL A-A- SE: King == 107.98 A-A- 0.73; Diomede == 110.13 A-A- 2.24) were significantly larger than female crabs at both locations. Weight of female crabs (mean A-A- SE: 810.0 A-A- 61.9 g) increased with CL according to a non-linear function; Crab weight == 0.00165**(CL)2.8995 (r2 == 0.86). Fecundity estimates based egg counts (mean A-A- SE: 62,955.6 A-A- 4981.2) were slightly higher than visual estimates of hatched larvae (mean A-A- SE: 56,570 A-A- 6690). Timing of larval release differed significantly between female crabs held in the laboratory for 1 and 13 months. Crabs held for 1 month began hatching in mid-May 2008 with more larvae released per day and over a shorter duration (12 d). Crabs held for 13 month released fewer larvae per day over a longer duration (20 d) starting in mid-February 2009. Long-term laboratory holding may impact hatch timing due to differences in ambient temperature and perhaps other suppressed seasonal effects of the artificial environment.},

	abstract = {The causes of the appearance of large blue king crabs ({Paralithodes platypus}) in Peter the Great Bay for the last decade are discussed. This species is an important commercial resource in the waters of Russian Far Eastern seas, and its general concentrations are related mainly to the sublittoral and upper bathyal zones of the northwestern {Bering Sea} and the northern Sea of Okhotsk. Until recently, this species has been observed in areas along the continental coast of the northwestern Sea of Japan up to the Peter the Great Bay, where it incidentally showed up in red king crab (P. camtschaticus) and snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) catches but was also commercially used. This area was considered as the southern periphery of the species range. Since the late 1990s, both male and female blue king crabs have been recorded in trawl and trap catches during research works conducted within the Peter the Great Bay. Since 2002, any commercial catches of shelf crab species are prohibited in the waters south of 47?20' N because of a dramatic decline in their populations. Since then all the illegally caught crabs, including blue king crabs that are seized live from poachers, are released back into the water in certain places of the bay. In total, at least 29 503 blue king crabs, including egg-bearing females, were released within the period from 2002 to November 2009. At present, the overall blue king crab abundance in Peter the Great Bay, estimated based on the trap catches over an area of 7048 km2, is 50500, the abundance of commercial-size males (with a carapace width over 130 mm) is 7500, and the male to female ratio is 1.00: 1.35. The increase in the blue king crab population observed in the bay is the result of the immigration of mature and viable individuals from other areas of its range. After this "uncontrolled introduction" blue king crabs adapted to new conditions, and then began breeding and spreading over the entire area of the bay.},

No carapace color change was observed even in heavily infected crabs, but diseased crabs possessed creamy-yellow hemolymph, which was visible through the arthrodial membranes of the abdomen and appendages. Several stages of the parasite's life history, including trophonts, plasmodia, sporonts and macrodinospores, were observed in tissues of infected king crabs. Numerous parasite cells were observed in the lumina of the myocardium, the gills, the connective tissue of antennal glands and the sinuses of nerve ganglia, eyestalks and gastrointestinal tract of king crabs with gross signs of infection. Based on sequencing of the 18S rDNA, it appears that the Hematodinium sp. found in red and blue king crabs is identical or closely related to Hematodinium sp. isolated from crabs of the genera Chionoecetes and Lithodes. Observed prevalences were 0.33{\%} in sublegal male red king crabs, 0.18{\%} in female red king crabs, 0.34{\%} in sublegal male blue king crabs and 0.31{\%} in female blue king crabs.},

	abstract = {{Paralithodes platypus} is a large decapod that inhabits {Alaska}n and North Pacific waters. Females exhibit a biennial spawning cycle, requiring two years for production of fully mature ooecytes. We used respirometry and video recording to determine: 1) metabolic rates of brooding and post-brooding females, embryos, and larvae at different temperatures, 2) if females exhibit active brood care, 3) oxygen availability within the clutch, and 4) the timing of larval hatching. The rates of oxygen consumption (MO2) of brooding females was significantly higher than that of post-brooding females at night, but was similar during the day and increased significantly with temperature. MO2 of crab embryos did not differ with position in the clutch, whereas MO2 of zoeae averaged 4-fold higher than that of embryos. Larvae from the periphery of the embryo mass, either top or bottom, hatched prior to larvae from the middle of the clutch. Oxygen availability in the embryo mass varied significantly with position in the clutch; saturation was highest at the top (\~{} 91{\%}), and lowest at the middle (\~{} 66{\%}). Flapping of the pleon in brooding females was coincident with sudden increases in oxygen availability at the bottom of the embryo mass. The percentage of time that brooding females were engaged in flapping of the pleon was 30{\%} higher at night than during the day. Our results address the cost of brooding in a lithodid crab and the effects of temperature on this behavior. The importance of pleonal flapping to ventilation of the embryo mass and alternative hatching mechanisms is discussed.},

The total lipid level (TL) in muscles ranged from 0.53{\%} of wet weight (ww) to 1.57{\%} of ww and the amount of phospholipids exceeded that of triglycerides. The TL contents in the hepatopancreas of all crabs were higher than in muscles and varied between 10.2{\%} ww in C. angulatus and 19.8{\%} ww in P. platypus, the major class of lipids being triglycerides. The main polar lipids in the hepatopancreas and muscles were phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Among polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the n-3 fatty acids have dominated; 16:0, 18:1n-9, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were the main fatty acids contained in the tissues studied. In all the crabs, excluding C. angulatus, the PUFAs n-3/n-6 ratio in muscles varied between 7.02 and 10.3 while, in the hepatopancreas, the ratio varied between 4.00 and 6.62.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of blue king crab (BKC) to the {Bering Sea} fishery, there has been no detailed study of juvenile habitat preferences. Such information is critical for understanding life history and for development of stock enhancement programs. The aims of this study were to determine the natural substrata that glaucothoe prefer to settle on, and whether they or subsequent crab 1 stage (C1) redistribute to different habitats over time. A laboratory experiment was performed in 24 round containers divided in four equal quadrants each filled with one of the following natural substrata: beach sand, gravel, shells and cobble. Containers were assigned to 8 groups of 3 replicates each and were kept at 6-8 super(o)C. Twenty five glaucothoe were released in each container on day 0, and one group of three replicates was removed for examination at each of the following intervals: 24 h, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49 days. Numbers of swimming and settled specimens on each substrate and period were recorded. Glaucothoe began to settle immediately after being released since no swimming larvae were found during any sampling periods. Substrata complexity was important for the habitat selection and distribution of blue king crab glaucothoe and crab 1 stage. During the glaucothoe stage, beach sand was rejected and cobble, shell and gravel were chosen equally. After glaucothoe molted to crab 1 stage and became bigger, animals preferred cobble and shell instead of gravel and beach sand. Understanding habitat selection is useful not only for management of crab populations, but also for assessing the potential of various habitats for stock enhancement of blue king crabs.},

	abstract = {Newly-hatched unenriched Artemia nauplii are often the primary diet in culturing red (Paralithodes camtschaticus) and blue (P. platypus) king crab larvae in the laboratory. Although this diet allows survival to the first juvenile crab stage (C1), rates are sub-optimal. This work reports on studies over the last two years investigating whether diets of enriched Artemia nauplii improve survival of red (RKC) and blue (BKC) king crab larvae. In 2003, RKC larvae were fed one of seven diets: (1) newly-hatched unenriched Artemia, (2-5) Artemia nauplii enriched with the microalga Rhodomonas salina, Isochrysis sp., Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii, or T. aestivalis, or (6-7) Artemia nauplii enriched with a commercial enrichment product, Isochrysis paste or Algamac 3050. The treatment that resulted in the highest survival to the non-feeding glaucothoe stage was T. nordenskioeldii (73{\%}) and the treatment that resulted in the highest survival to CI was Isochrysis paste (63{\%}). Lowest survival to both stages occurred in the newly-hatched nauplii treatments (42{\%} and 30{\%}). Based on these results, BKC larvae were fed one of four diets in 2004: 1) Artemia nauplii enriched with the diatom T. nordenskioeldii, 2) Artemia nauplii enriched with frozen Isochrysis paste, 3) newly-hatched unenriched Artemia with T. nordenskioeldii added to the culture water and 4) no food. The treatment that resulted in the highest survival through C1 was newly-hatched Artemia with T. nordenskioeldii added to the culture water (91.7{\%}). This diet is superior to either enriched Artemia nauplii or unenriched newly-hatched Artemia for king crab larvae cultured in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {During the last three decades, population abundances of eastern {Bering Sea} (EBS) crab stocks fluctuated greatly, driven by highly variable recruitment. In recent years, abundances of these stocks have been very low compared to historical levels. This study aims to understand recruitment variation of six stocks of red king (Paralithodes camtschaticus), blue king (P. platypus), {Tanner} (Chionoecetes bairdi), and snow (C. opilio) crabs in the EBS. Most crab recruitment time series are not significantly correlated with each other. Spatial distributions of three broadly distributed crab stocks (EBS snow and {Tanner} crabs and Bristol Bay red king crab) have changed considerably over time, possibly related in part to the regime shift in climate and physical oceanography in 1976-1977. Three climate-forcing hypotheses on larval survival have been proposed to explain crab recruitment variation of Bristol Bay red king crab and EBS {Tanner} and snow crabs. Some empirical evidence supports speculation that groundfish predation may play an important role in crab recruitment success in the EBS. However, spatial dynamics in the geographic distributions of groundfish and crabs over time make it difficult to relate crab recruitment strength to groundfish biomass. Comprehensive field and spatially explicit modeling studies are needed to test the hypotheses and better understand the relative importance and compound effects of bottom-up and top-down controls on crab recruitment.},

@book{Stevens2005,
	abstract = {Crab species in the Gulf of {Alaska} have a variety of reproductive strategies. One aspect that may contribute greatly to reproductive success or failure is the timing of hatching. In six species investigated to date, three different patterns have emerged. Red and blue king crabs Paralithodes camtschaticus and P. platypus (both anomurans), at continental shelf depths, have protracted hatching, requiring 30 days per crab. Primiparous females have longer embryonic development times, and hatch earlier in the year, whereas multiparous females hatch progressively later with age. Hatching of a discrete population may take place over a period of 3 months. In contrast, hatching by {Tanner} crabs Chionoecetes bairdi (a brachyuran), from similar environments, requires only 6 days per crab, and is synchronized with the spring tide cycle. Differences in embryonic development and hatching time between primiparous and multiparous females in this species are not as great. The intertidal anomuran Hapalogaster mertensii hatches larvae in April, but does not produce a new clutch until September, and only carries embryos for about 7 months, as opposed to the king and {Tanner} crabs that extrude new clutches immediately after hatching, and carry them for 11-12 months. Timing of embryonic development and hatching are greatly influenced by temperature and probably contribute strongly to survival of larvae and juveniles. Hatch timing may be a mechanism by which periodic or long-term climate change directly influences population variability.},

Prior to conducting research on juvenile crab biology, it was necessary to develop techniques for cultivating them in the laboratory. In this experiment, we tested the effects of diet, temperature, and rearing density on survival of larvae to the first crab stage. Four different diets were tested including: UNFED zoea were not fed in order to determine if they could survive on stored yolk (lecithotrophic); THAL treatment was fed with Artemia nauplii enriched by feeding with diatoms Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii; Art +THAL treatment was fed with unenriched Artemia plus live Thalassiosira; ISO 6 was a control diet of Artemia enriched by feeding with frozen Isochrysis paste. All diets were tested at 6 C, and a density of 10 zoea per liter, with 6 replicates per treatment. The ISO diet was also tested at 3 C (ISO 3) and 9 C (ISO 9), and at densities of 20 (ISO 20) and 40 (ISO 40) zoea per liter. Crab zoeae were cultivated in PVC tubes with 625 mu m mesh on the bottom. Each tube was placed in a glass beaker filled with filtered and UV-sterilized seawater. Tubes (with larvae) were transferred to beakers with fresh seawater daily, and fed via pipette. Dead larvae and molted exuviae were removed daily, and complete counts were made at weekly intervals until all larvae molted to first stage crabs. Survival on the A+THAL diet (91.7{\%}) was significantly higher than all others, whereas UNFED larvae died within two weeks. Survival in all other treatments was not significantly different. Survival decreased slightly with increasing temperature, but not significantly. Density had no significant effect on survival, but final mean density (16 zoeal-1) was similar in the ISO 20 and ISO 40 treatments suggesting that a maximum carrying capacity for these conditions had been reached. Length of development to the first juvenile crab stage (C1) was significantly longer (109 d) at 3 C than at 6 C (70 d), but did not decrease further at 9 C. CONCLUSIONS: Blue king crab larvae can be cultivated with high survival using the proper diet. Larvae are not lecithotrophic and must be fed. A temperature of 6 C is optimal for survival and length of development. These results will be used to produce larger numbers of juvenile crab for laboratory research. In addition, these techniques could be modified for use in enhancement of wild crab stocks.},

	abstract = {Survey abundance of a stock can drop sharply from one year to the next. Typically, for fish stocks, stock assessment scientists assume that the sharp decrease in abundance is caused by changes in survey catchability, not natural mortality. However, for crab stocks, occasional sharp drops in abundance can be caused by an increase in natural mortality from massive dieoffs, which are substantiated by subsequent annual surveys. Lacking auxiliary data on changes in catchability and mortality, stock assessment modelers are challenged to provide fishery management advice for the year in which the shift in survey abundance occurs. In this study, we used the 1999 stock assessment of St. Matthew Island blue king crabs ({Paralithodes platypus}) as an example to demonstrate our approach. First, we searched for evidence of an increase in natural mortality and decrease in survey catchability. The available evidence was not conclusive enough to rule out either cause. Second, we developed a four-stage catch-survey model to assess the stock under different assumptions of natural mortality in 1999. Finally, we used the model to evaluate the consequences of different natural mortality assumptions on the stock by projecting the stock abundance into the near future. We suggest that a conservative management approach should be taken when the stock-recruitment relationship may be depensatory or when the handling mortality rate of crab bycatch may be high.},

	abstract = {In the northwestern part of the {Bering Sea}, large aggregations of blue king crab, {Paralithodes platypus}, are known from the Gulf of Olyutorsk to the Gulf of Anadyr. It is believed that these aggregations are portions of a single population. Maximum densities (12-21 individuals per trap) of commercial males were observed in winter at depths of 120-250 m during trapping and diving surveys in 1998-2000. Juveniles of both sexes (carapace width 21-49 mm) with densities of 7-12 individuals per m super(2) were found in Glubokaya Inlet at a depth of 15 m in summer. In summer, egg-bearing females were found along the coast at depths of 6-10 m, while mature females without eggs were caught at depths of 50-80 m. In winter, egg-bearing females were caught at depths of 130-180 m, while females without eggs were not caught at all. We concluded that the Olyutorsk-Navarin population has three centers of reproduction: the Gulf of Anadyr, the area to the west of Cape Navarin, and the area of Natalia and Glubokaya inlets. The total abundance of commercial male blue king crabs from the Gulf of Olyutorsk to Cape Navarin was approximately 3 million individuals in 2000.},

	abstract = {The distribution, fecundity, egg size, and reproductive season of the red Paralithodes camtschatica, blue P. platypus, and golden king crab Lithodes aequispina from the region of the Kuril Archipelago were considered. It was recorded that red and blue crabs form aggregations of commercial value only in the North and South Kurils. There are no aggregations of red and blue crab along a stretch of 440 km from Urup Strait to Krenitsyn Strait in the Middle Kurils. The golden king crab L. aequispina is widespread along the whole Kuril Archipelago, from Kunashir Island to Atlasov Island. Commercial size aggregations of this species were found at Iturup, Simushir, Ketoi, Ushishir, Shiashkotan and Makanrushi islands. L. aequispina, in contrast to Paralithodes species, was specific with lower fecundity, larger egg size, and unpronounced seasonal dynamics of reproduction. The considered reproductive parameters enable us to conclude that red and blue king crabs display a distinct r-strategy trend, while the golden king crab, a K-strategy trend. The existence of lecithotrophic larvae in the latter species at early development stage with demersal type of development was assumed. This assumption corresponded well to the data on distribution of this species in the central part of the Kuril Archipelago and on the relative independence of the larvae on the intensity and direction of surface currents. The species with planktotrophic larvae (red and blue crabs) are unable to occupy a narrow band of island shelf of the Middle Kurils because of larval drift by strong currents away from sites suitable for juvenile growth and habitation of adults.},

	abstract = {We conducted a modified catch-survey analysis incorporating commercial catch per unit effort and bottom-trawl survey data for the blue king crab stock, {Paralithodes platypus}, near St. Matthew Island in the eastern {Bering Sea}. Although the general area was surveyed to estimate abundance of crabs, the commercial fleet fished over a more limited and generally untrawlable portion of the surveyed area. Therefore, the current abundance estimation procedure based on assessment surveys was modified to include fishery performance data to explore the utility of both types of data in estimating abundance. Total annual catch and observed relative survey abundance of legal-sized crabs were classified into recruits and postrecruits by shell age and size, and commercial fishing effort was defined as total potlifts. The analysis separated measurement errors from the true changes in population abundance and converted the relative abundance to an absolute value. The analysis also provided smoothed annual estimates of the legal blue king crab abundance. Based on a probable range of instantaneous natural mortality (0.16 to 0.35) and fishing effort weighting factors (0.5 and 1.0), we estimated survey catchability to be 0.91 to 1.25. Weighting the fishing effort heavier or assuming higher natural mortality resulted in lower estimates of survey catchability. Because of confounded effects among survey catchability and natural mortality, additional information is needed to reliably estimate these parameters.},

In some stocks, this problem is of such magnitude that sequential population analyses (SPA) are deemed inapplicable. The eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS) cod fishery, which displays the retrospective problem, and simulated data are analysed to provide insight into the causes and potential solutions to this problem. The retrospective problem is shown to be a result of the traditional analysis techniques and a non-stationarity in the data used in the population analysis. A moving window analysis is developed which allows the non-stationarities to be identified and in some cases rectified. Recommendations are also made for ad hoc investigations of the data. The analysis suggests that failure to correct the retrospective problem for a stock with data like ESS cod could lead to catch-level advice that would be twice or more the intended level.}",

Results of a STARS application to the eastern {Bering Sea} ecosystem show how the 1989 and 1998 regime shifts manifest themselves in biotic and abiotic indices in comparison with the 1977 shift.}",

abstract = {Theoretical considerations and applied examples suggest that stock assessments are highly sensitive to the weighting of different data sources whenever data sources conflict regarding parameter estimates. Previous iterative reweighting approaches to weighting compositional data are generally ad hoc, do not propagate uncertainty about data-weighting when calculating uncertainty intervals, and often are not re-adjusted when conducting sensitivity or retrospective analyses. We therefore incorporate the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution into Stock Synthesis, and propose it as a model-based method for estimating effective sample size. This distribution incorporates one additional parameter per fleet (with the option of mirroring its value among fleets), and we show that this parameter governs the ratio of nominal (“input”) and effective (“output”) sample size. We demonstrate this approach using data for Pacific hake, where the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution and an iterative reweighting approach previously developed by McAllister and Ianelli (1997) give similar results. We also use simulation testing to explore the estimation properties of this new estimator, and show that it provides approximately unbiased estimates of variance inflation when compositional samples capture clusters of individuals with similar ages/lengths. We conclude by recommending further research to develop computationally efficient estimators of effective sample size that are based on alternative, a priori consideration of sampling theory and population biology.}

Using summer bottom trawl survey data from 1982 to 2017, spatial analyses and geostatistical regressions were conducted for each species for three population categories (immature females, oldshell mature females, and oldshell large males) to explore intra and interspecies differences in habitat and spatial distributions as well as interspecific spatial co-occurrence patterns. Variability in depth distributions rather than poleward distributional shifts may be a {{{Tanner}} crab} response to ocean warming, the apparent converse of snow crab. Both temperature and depth have strong effects on the {{{Tanner}} crab} distributions and 2 °C is an approximate minimum temperature threshold for {{{Tanner}} crab} habitat. 2 °C is an important maximum temperature threshold for immature female snow crab but temperature effects are weaker for adult snow crab. Snow crab ontogenetic movement results in loose coupling between settlement and adult habitat and in significant spatial overlap between older snow crab and {{{Tanner}} crab}. The similarity in spatial distributions and habitat of older snow crab with juvenile {{{Tanner}} crab} habitat and the predatory nature of snow suggest a possible regulatory role of snow crab on the northern extent of spatial distributions of {{{Tanner}} crab}, along with other possible factors such as groundfish predation. Snow crab distributions will most probably continue to shift northwards with warming ocean temperatures but a poleward shift for {{{Tanner}} crab} appears more uncertain. The utilities of comparing spatial and non-spatial models and accounting for spatial confounding in spatial regression modeling are also addressed.}

abstract = {The eastern {Bering Sea} (EBS) population of {{{Tanner}} crab} ({\textit{Chionoecetes bairdi}}) has exhibited high variability in recruitment to the commercially exploited stock since the late 1970s. Concurrently, apparent shifts in crab distribution have also been observed. Larval advection patterns and associated local retention offer a potential mechanism for these observations. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) was used to simulate larval {{{Tanner}} crab} advection patterns over 1978–2004 based on larval hatching sites inferred from the distributions of reproductive females sampled during annual National Marine Fisheries Service trawl surveys. Connectivity among EBS subregions was examined by comparing start and end float locations after 60days of simulated drift. High levels of retention (>50% of floats) were observed in the majority of source subregions, and contributed significantly to the total number of endpoints in each region. Patterns in advection and resultant interregional connectivity were variable, with strongest sustained connectivity occurring along shelf, within individual domains. Increased settlement potential in the outer domain and southern middle domain after 1990 is consistent with an observed geographic shift in fishery productivity. Apparent reliance of Bristol Bay on local larval retention validates recent spatial fishery management to conserve this area as a subpopulation.}

abstract = {Highly variable recruitment and a complex harvest strategy resulted in dramatic inter-annual changes in historical catches, including prolonged closure periods, for {Bering Sea} {{{Tanner}} crab} ({\textit{Chionoecetes bairdi}}). Current management regulations, linked to recent frequent closures, led to an industry-initiated cooperative effort to reevaluate the harvest control rule (HCR) that forms part of the State of {Alaska} harvest strategy. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) was used to assess conservation and economic trade-offs of fifteen HCR options that differed in how females were considered. Several male-only HCRs performed similarly to those that accounted for females. However, the inclusion of both sexes reflected conservation and economic objectives while acknowledging the uncertainty around reproductive dynamics. The HCR selected by the {Alaska} Board of Fisheries included a threshold for opening the fishery based on mature male biomass (MMB), scalars based on relative levels of mature female biomass (MFB) and MMB that determine the exploitation rate on MMB, and a maximum exploitation cap on industry-preferred sizes of legal males. This work illustrates how manager-stakeholder collaboration may enable improved fishery management. Our analysis provided managers with a tool to facilitate productive and transparent dialogue with industry, with the goal of accounting for conservation and economic objectives, given some of the underlying biological uncertainty associated with reproductive dynamics. This study demonstrates that the inclusion of reproductive buffers in HCRs for male-only fisheries may be able to better achieve conservation goals without sacrificing economic performance.}
